# Smart Traffic Light System with Emergency Vehicle Preemption

## Project Overview

The **Smart Traffic Light System** is designed to optimize traffic flow in urban environments by incorporating **emergency vehicle priority** and **adaptive signal timing**. This system dynamically adjusts traffic signal behavior to provide faster and safer passage for emergency vehicles and minimize unnecessary wait times for other vehicles.

### Key Features

#### 1. Priority for Emergency Vehicles
- When an emergency vehicle (such as an **ambulance** or **fire truck**) approaches an intersection, the traffic light system gives immediate priority to that vehicle.
- The corresponding traffic signal lane turns green, ensuring quick passage for the emergency vehicle while other lanes remain red, thus providing faster and safer transit.

#### 2. Adaptive Signal Timing
- The system is designed to optimize the use of traffic signal timing.
- If a **green signal** is active on one side but **no vehicles** are detected in that lane, the system automatically switches the signal to the next phase.
- This reduces unnecessary delays and improves overall traffic flow by dynamically adjusting signal changes based on real-time conditions.

## Project Components

- **Sensors**: Used to detect the presence of vehicles and the approach of emergency vehicles.
- **Traffic Light Controller**: Manages the logic for signal timing and emergency vehicle prioritization.
- **Emergency Vehicle Detection**: A mechanism for detecting approaching emergency vehicles and triggering an immediate priority change in the traffic signal.

## Technologies Used

- **Hardware**: Microcontrollers (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi), Traffic light system components (LEDs, relays), Sensors (IR sensors, ultrasonic sensors, etc.), Communication modules (if required).
- **Software**: 
  - **Embedded C** for microcontroller programming.
  - Signal control algorithms for adaptive timing and emergency vehicle preemption.
